\subsubsection*{3.1.4 IR Array Sensor}
IR (Infrared) array sensors are used to detect the path for line-following by emitting and detecting IR light. A group of IR sensors is arranged to detect black lines on a white surface. In this project, they help the robot follow the designated path. [Source: \href{https://www.giganepal.com/product/ir-sensor-array-module-4-way/?v=584a79c5e916}{IR Array Sensor on GigaNepal}]
